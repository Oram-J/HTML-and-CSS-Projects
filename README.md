# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

# This repository will contain all of the HTML and CSS Projects for my boot camp at the Tech Academy. I may have a fork of this at some point for personal use as I plan on utilizing some of the knowledge I gain from these projects to better build my own website nichevo.io

# This is a sample of websites that I made using HTML and CSS.
